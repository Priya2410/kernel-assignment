# kernel-assignment

The Hello World Kernel module doesn't compile for some reason. fix it and send a patch to bkkarthik@pesu.pes.edu
While you're doing that, also change the occurance of "NAME" to your full name in "module.c"

Once you recieve a positive reply telling "Thanks!" or "You can now submit this", take a print of the entire email conversation (not on paper, but as a pdf) and turn it in on teams.
